        # READ THIS BEFORE OPENING AN ISSUE
  
        **This issue tracker is not for support requests!**
        If you need help with crashes or any other issues, please ask for help in [Camo's Discord server]() instead of opening and issue here.
        In addition, please make sure you have at least done the following:
  
        - **Have you ensured that all of your mods (including Enriched) are up-to-date?**
        The latest version of Enriched can be found on either [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CamoMano/Enriched/releases) or
        its [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enriched).
        
        - **Have you used the [search tool](https://github.com/CamoMano/Enriched/issues) to see if your issue has already been reported?**
        If so, you should leave a comment under the existing issue to add any additional information, if you have any,
            
        - **Have you created a base set of instructions to reproduce the issue?**
        If your issue only occurs with other mods installed, then you should try to narrow down exactly which mods are causing the issue.
        Please don't provide a list of all of the mods you use and expect us to figure out which ones are problematic.

        **Tip**: You can find the game's log files within the `.minecraft/logs` directory. Most often, you only need to provide the `latest.log` file as that holds the logs
        to the most recently played session of the game, but you can provide the other ones if you find it necessary.

        Drag and drop the log file(s) here.

        If even the issue doesn't cause the game to crash, a crash report will still be useful. This is because it contains important hardware and software configuration. You
        can manually crash by the holding down the F3 + C keys together for about 10 seconds. This works anywhere in the game such as on the title screen or while in a world.
        
        **Tip**: You can usually find crash reports within the `.minecraft/crash-reports` directory.
